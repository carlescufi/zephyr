64KB RAM, embedded 2.4GHz multi-protocol transceiver, power amplifier, and an
integrated PCB trace antenna, or an u.FL connector for external antenna. It
allows faster time to market with reduced development cost.

For applications needing limited number of IO pins, prototyping and production
are easier using 16 castellated pins. Additional 24 LGA (Land Grid Array) pins
provide access to 29 GPIOs of nRF52832.

Line of sight range between 2 BT832X is 1170 meters. Ranges between 2 BT832XE
with ANT060 external antenna is 1350 meters.
