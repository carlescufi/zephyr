   When we import rpmsg-lite we removed the doc and deoxygen directories
   to reduce amount of unnecessery files imported.
Purpose:
   IPC layer that implements rpmsg-lite communication between cores.

Description:

This documentation describes the RPMsg-Lite component, which is a lightweight
implementation of the Remote Processor Messaging (RPMsg) protocol. The RPMsg
protocol defines a standardized binary interface used to communicate between
multiple cores in a heterogeneous multicore system.

Compared to the RPMsg implementation of the Open Asymmetric Multi Processing
(OpenAMP) framework (https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp), the RPMsg-Lite offers
a code size reduction, API simplification, and improved modularity. On smaller
Cortex-M0+ based systems, it is recommended to use RPMsg-Lite.

The RPMsg-Lite is an open-source component developed by NXP Semiconductors
and released under the BSD-compatible license.
